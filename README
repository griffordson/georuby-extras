== DESCRIPTION:

GeoRuby-Extras Gem for Ruby (c) 2008 David Troy
dave@roundhousetech.com

GeoRuby-Extras offers some native C enhancements and extras to the popular GeoRuby gem.

GeoRuby offers OGC-compliant simple features for Ruby as well as the ability to
process SHP files and do other cool GIS hacks.  GeoRuby is often used in conjunction
with GIS extensions for popular databases including Postgres and MySQL.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Provides native C implementation of Vincenty distance and direct algorithms.
* 25 times faster than GeoRuby 'ellipsoidal_distance' function.
* Adds the Vincenty 'direct' algorithm (point_at_bearing_and_distance).
* Provides native C implementation of a ray casting algorithm to detect if a point is contained in a polygon.
* No known problems; won't work with JRuby or non-MRI Ruby implementations.
* Compatible with Ruby 1.8.7 and 1.9.x

== SYNOPSIS:

require 'rubygems'
require 'georuby-extras'

include GeoRuby::SimpleFeatures
  
@home = Point.from_lon_lat(-76.511,39.024)
@nyc = Point.from_lon_lat(-74,40.6)

>> @home.ellipsoidal_distance(@nyc)
=> 277195.510448391

>> @home.point_at_bearing_and_distance(91.0, 130000.0).kml_representation
=> "<Point>\n<coordinates>-75.0105920700835,38.9939120193168</coordinates>\n</Point>\n"

== REQUIREMENTS:

* GCC and a Gnu-ish build environment (for native extensions)
